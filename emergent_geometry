# Emergent Geometry in CIG

Geometry in CIG arises from informational dependence among agents.

## 1. Statistical Manifold

Agents are described by parameterized distributions \( p_\theta(x) \),
forming a statistical manifold \( \Theta \).

The Fisher–Rao metric

\[
g_{ij}(\theta) = 
\mathbb{E}\left[
\partial_i \log p_\theta(x) \, \partial_j \log p_\theta(x)
\right]
\]

provides an intrinsic information-geometric structure.

## 2. Informational Integration

Total correlation \( I(\theta) \) measures global dependence among agents.

The Hessian of \( I \) with respect to the Fisher metric generates curvature:

\[
K_{ij} = \mathrm{Hess}_g I.
\]

Integration acts as a geometric “source”.

## 3. Correlation-Weighted Graph Laplacians

Dependence structure defines weighted graphs.  
Their Laplacians converge (in the continuum limit) to the Laplace–Beltrami operator
of an emergent metric \( g^* \):

\[
L_\varepsilon f \to -c_d \, \Delta_{g^*} f.
\]

## 4. Conformal Metric

Informational dependence modifies the geometry via a local conformal factor:

\[
g^*(x) = \lambda(x) \, g_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(\theta(x)).
\]

Where \( \lambda(x) \) contracts or expands space depending on the
strength of informational coupling.

## 5. Induced Gravity

A fluctuation expansion of the CIG functional yields an
**Einstein–Hilbert term**:

\[
S_{\text{eff}} \sim \int \sqrt{|g^*|} \, R[g^*] \, dx,
\]

showing that classical gravity emerges from informational fluctuations.

CIG therefore provides a fully classical, information-geometric route to
spacetime and gravitational dynamics.
