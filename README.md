# Conscious Information Geometry (CIG)

**A unified information-geometric framework for emergent spacetime, gravity, and conscious integration.**  
Repository: https://github.com/CIG-Research/Conscious-Information-Geometry

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Conscious Information Geometry (CIG)** proposes that:

- **Informational integration** among agents forms the foundation of structure.  
- **Geometry** emerges from informational dependence via Fisher information metrics.  
- **Curvature** corresponds to changes in integration (Hessians of total correlation).  
- **Gravity** appears as *induced dynamics* from fluctuations on the informational manifold.  
- **Spacetime** is the *projection* of deeper informational processes.  

CIG offers a **neutral, epistemic, and classical** framework capable of connecting:

- General Relativity  
- Quantum Theory (via potential quantum information extensions)  
- Information Geometry  
- Cognitive and conscious processes  

This repository contains documentation, diagrams, code examples, and supporting material for the CIG preprint.

## 🧩 Core Idea

CIG is built on a **four-level ontology**:

Consciousness (phenomenal domain, not modeled directly)

Information (statistical structure, agents, correlations)

Geometry (emergent via Fisher metric & integration)

Spacetime (projection of emergent geometry)


Levels 2–4 are **mathematically modeled**;  
Level 1 is **conceptually acknowledged** but left metaphysically open.

## ✨ Key Contributions

### **1. Emergent Fisher Geometry**
Agents defined by distributions \( p_\theta(x) \) form a statistical manifold Θ.  
The Fisher–Rao metric gives rise to a natural geometry.

### **2. Integration → Curvature**
Total correlation \( I(\theta) \) produces curvature through:

\[
K_{ij} = \text{Hess}_g I
\]

### **3. Conformal Metric Emergence**
A correlation-dependent conformal factor λ(x) deforms the Fisher metric:

\[
g^*(x) = \lambda(x) \, g_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(\theta(x))
\]

### **4. Induced Gravity**
Fluctuation expansions of the CIG action lead to an **Einstein–Hilbert term**,  
paralleling **Sakharov-induced gravity**.

### **5. Philosophical Neutrality**
CIG does *not* make metaphysical claims.  
It is compatible with:

- Physicalism  
- Dual-aspect monism  
- Panpsychism  
- Idealism  
- Constructivism  

…but it commits to none of them.
