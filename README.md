# Conscious Information Geometry (CIG)

**A unified information-geometric framework for emergent spacetime, gravity, and conscious integration.**  
Repository: https://github.com/CIG-Research/Conscious-Information-Geometry

## 🧭 Overview

**Conscious Information Geometry (CIG)** proposes that:

- **Informational integration** among agents forms the foundation of structure.  
- **Geometry** emerges from informational dependence via Fisher information metrics.  
- **Curvature** corresponds to changes in integration (Hessians of total correlation).  
- **Gravity** appears as *induced dynamics* from fluctuations on the informational manifold.  
- **Spacetime** is the *projection* of deeper informational processes.  

CIG offers a **neutral, epistemic, and classical** framework capable of connecting:

- General Relativity  
- Quantum Theory (via potential quantum information extensions)  
- Information Geometry  
- Cognitive and conscious processes  

This repository contains documentation, diagrams, code examples, and supporting material for the CIG preprint.

## 🧩 Core Idea

CIG is built on a **four-level ontology**:

Consciousness (phenomenal domain, not modeled directly)

Information (statistical structure, agents, correlations)

Geometry (emergent via Fisher metric & integration)

Spacetime (projection of emergent geometry)


Levels 2–4 are **mathematically modeled**;  
Level 1 is **conceptually acknowledged** but left metaphysically open.

## ✨ Key Contributions

### **1. Emergent Fisher Geometry**
Agents defined by distributions \( p_\theta(x) \) form a statistical manifold Θ.  
The Fisher–Rao metric gives rise to a natural geometry.

### **2. Integration → Curvature**
Total correlation \( I(\theta) \) produces curvature through:

\[
K_{ij} = \text{Hess}_g I
\]

### **3. Conformal Metric Emergence**
A correlation-dependent conformal factor λ(x) deforms the Fisher metric:

\[
g^*(x) = \lambda(x) \, g_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(\theta(x))
\]

### **4. Induced Gravity**
Fluctuation expansions of the CIG action lead to an **Einstein–Hilbert term**,  
paralleling **Sakharov-induced gravity**.

### **5. Philosophical Neutrality**
CIG does *not* make metaphysical claims.  
It is compatible with:

- Physicalism  
- Dual-aspect monism  
- Panpsychism  
- Idealism  
- Constructivism  

…but it commits to none of them.

## 🌌 CIG as a Unifying Framework Across Physics and Information

CIG provides a coherent informational foundation from which geometric and
dynamical structures may emerge. The appearance of a conformally Fisher metric,
the derivation of Einstein-like dynamics through fluctuation-induced terms, and
the interpretation of systems as informational agents collectively suggest that
spacetime, gravity, and classical behavior could be secondary manifestations of
deeper informational organization.

Although the present formulation is classical, the architecture naturally
extends toward quantum information geometry by replacing probability
distributions with density matrices and adopting quantum Fisher metrics. This
offers a potential pathway toward relating general relativity and quantum theory
within a shared informational framework.

In this sense, CIG outlines a unifying structural perspective in which physics,
information, and integrated cognitive processes can be represented within a
single mathematically explicit model—without making claims of completeness or
finality.
