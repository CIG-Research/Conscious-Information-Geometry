# Conceptual Overview of Conscious Information Geometry (CIG)

Conscious Information Geometry (CIG) is an information-theoretic framework in which
**informational integration** among agents gives rise to **geometric structure**, and
ultimately to **spacetime-like behavior**.

CIG operates on a four-level ontology:

1. **Consciousness**  
   – acknowledged but not modeled.  
2. **Information**  
   – agents, probability laws, dependence relations.  
3. **Geometry**  
   – Fisher metric, informational curvature, emergent metric.  
4. **Spacetime**  
   – projection of geometric structure into physical observables.

CIG is both **epistemically neutral** and **mathematically explicit**.  
It does not specify what reality *is*, but how informational structures can be
represented and how geometry can arise from them.

The key mechanism is:

> **Informational integration → curvature → emergent metric → spacetime structure.**

The formalism is classical, but open to quantum extension.
