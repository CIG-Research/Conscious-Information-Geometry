# Metaphysical Interpretations Compatible with CIG

CIG is mathematically defined and metaphysically flexible.
Several interpretations are compatible with the framework:

## 1. Physicalism
Information and geometry arise from physical substrates.  
CIG describes functional architecture of the brain or other physical systems.

## 2. Dual-Aspect Monism
Informational structure = outer aspect.  
Subjective experience = inner aspect.  
Both arise from a neutral underlying domain.

## 3. Panpsychism
Each informational agent possesses a proto-experiential aspect.  
Integration generates unified experience.

## 4. Idealism
Level 1 (consciousness) is fundamental.  
Levels 2–4 are projections of conscious relations.

## 5. Constructivism
Geometry and spacetime are constructed appearances generated by informational organization, not mind-independent entities.

These interpretations differ in their metaphysics,
but they leave the mathematics of CIG unchanged.

This flexibility is intentional:  
CIG describes **the structure of emergent geometry**,  
not the ultimate nature of reality.
