# Philosophical Positioning of CIG

CIG takes an explicitly **epistemic**, not **metaphysical**, stance.

The framework specifies:
- how informational integration generates geometric structure,  
- how geometry induces dynamical behavior,  
- how spacetime may be understood as a projection of deeper structure.

CIG *does not* claim:
- that consciousness causes spacetime,
- that spacetime is fundamental,
- that information is ontologically primary.

The theory remains agnostic.  
It provides a **formal correspondence**, not a metaphysical ontology.

This neutrality ensures:
- empirical testability,
- compatibility with multiple philosophical worldviews,
- scientific credibility,
- freedom for future interpretation.
